# Roadmap

## 0.11.0 baseline

- Direct opted-in Tcl entry and package `machteld 0.11.0`.
- Process control: supervised `run`, `child`, `wait`, and `scope`; independent
  `detach`.
- ConPTY interaction with `pty expect` and `pty strip`.
- Filesystem observation and traversal: `watch`, `dirs`, `links`, and `canon`.
- Machine processes, WinHTTP, JSON, CNG hashes/random, and static SQLite store.
- Program support: `cli`, `log`, `worker`, `pool`, and `pmap`.
- Explicit native/Tcl manifest metadata and complete embedded Machteld, Tcl 9,
  and Tk 9 reference with agent-oriented query, verification, and extraction.
- Atomic console/GUI `wrap` with hidden assets and the complete runtime.

## Stabilization before breadth

1. Gate the opt-in parser, direct host, both wrapped hosts, and `EntryCheck`
   against the same entry corpus.
2. Check every manifest command, subcommand, option, result key, and error code
   against behavior, including protocol reply codes.
3. Stress process-tree cleanup, channel closure, ConPTY teardown, worker death,
   pool replacement, SQLite contention, and atomic wrapper failure paths.
4. Keep package versions and the machine-control/data surface identical across
   all produced executables; test the documented distribution-only exceptions.
5. Measure startup, idle memory, and packaging size after the product cut.

## 0.12.0 — the cell grows capabilities

Three additions are committed, not candidates. Each enters as an emitter
capability under the oracle — never as user-facing Lua; the seam stays
closed — and the two vendored libraries enter through the dependency lock
exactly as Lua itself did.

1. **Open the built-in `utf8` library in the cell** and implement
   character semantics in the emitter: `utf8.len` agrees with Tcl's
   `string length` on characters, converting today's `string length`
   refusal into a proven construct. Zero vendoring; the admission test is
   an é-heavy oracle fixture agreeing across all arms.
2. **LPeg** (MIT, pinned lock entry): parsing inside kernels at C speed —
   the ingestion direction's substrate, starting with in-cell field
   splitting. Admitted with byte-honest semantics specified against their
   Tcl counterparts, oracle-proven or refused by name.
3. **lua-cjson** (MIT, pinned lock entry): JSON decoded inside the cell so
   kernels run over JSON-lines data directly. The palette's `json` verb
   remains the Tcl-side organ; this is in-kernel data access, not a
   shadow of it.

## 0.12.0 — the palette gains xml (decided 2026-08-20)

Solid XML handling, validation included, is committed for 0.12.0 as a
palette organ beside `json` — runtime capability, not an extensions-covenant
errand. The deciding programs are the rail-family operations formats
(railML, NeTEx, TAF/TSI, Darwin push data): schema-described XML is the
data plane of long-lived operations environments, and a runtime that
promises "just works for years" must read it in the box.

Recorded as constraints, not answers — the route is design work:

- The leading vendor candidate is tDOM 0.9.7 (C, Tcl 9-ready, bundles
  expat 2.7.3): DOM, XPath, DTD validation, and its own schema engine,
  statically linkable the way SQLite and Lua entered, pinned through the
  dependency lock with its license notices verified and carried. A narrower
  expat-based organ is the fallback if tDOM's surface proves too wide for a
  palette contract.
- "Validation" is pinned by name during design: well-formedness always;
  DTD and tDOM's schema engine are on the table; full W3C XML Schema is
  deliberately not claimed — that claim costs Xerces-class machinery the
  covenant refuses. Whatever subset ships is stated exactly, and the rest
  is refused by name, never approximated.
- The usual admission bar applies: a narrow Tcl-shaped contract, structured
  `{MACHTELD XML ...}` failures with depth/size guards the way `json` has
  them, external-entity and all network resolution refused by default (the
  classic XML trap), manifest metadata, and tests on real rail-format
  fixtures plus hostile ones (XXE, entity expansion, depth bombs).

## Candidate additions

Windows registry, services, event log, network facts, users, host facts, and
selected WMI queries remain candidates. None is promised by 0.11.0. Each needs a
concrete program, a narrow Tcl-shaped contract, structured failures, manifest
metadata, and tests on real Windows behavior before admission.

The extensions covenant (see [External libraries](extensions.md)) names its
own candidate machinery: a wrap-time dependency resolver that classifies a
program's requires as in-box, payload, or sidecar; a hashed manifest beside
the output; and a `--deps` mode that verifies it on the target. The policy
is contracted now; the machinery follows the same admission bar as every
verb.

The route to 1.0 is a smaller surface whose invariants have survived use, not a
longer list of verbs. New policy layers and bundled applications are out of
scope for the runtime itself.
