# Roadmap

## 0.11.0 baseline

- Direct opted-in Tcl entry and package `machteld 0.11.0`.
- Process control: supervised `run`, `child`, `wait`, and `scope`; independent
  `detach`.
- ConPTY interaction with `pty expect` and `pty strip`.
- Filesystem observation and traversal: `watch`, `dirs`, `links`, and `canon`.
- Machine processes, WinHTTP, JSON, CNG hashes/random, and static SQLite store.
- Program support: `cli`, `log`, `worker`, `pool`, and `pmap`.
- Explicit native/Tcl manifest metadata and complete embedded Machteld, Tcl 9,
  and Tk 9 reference with agent-oriented query, verification, and extraction.
- Atomic console/GUI `wrap` with hidden assets and the complete runtime.

## Stabilization before breadth

1. Gate the opt-in parser, direct host, both wrapped hosts, and `EntryCheck`
   against the same entry corpus.
2. Check every manifest command, subcommand, option, result key, and error code
   against behavior, including protocol reply codes.
3. Stress process-tree cleanup, channel closure, ConPTY teardown, worker death,
   pool replacement, SQLite contention, and atomic wrapper failure paths.
4. Keep package versions and the machine-control/data surface identical across
   all produced executables; test the documented distribution-only exceptions.
5. Measure startup, idle memory, and packaging size after the product cut.

## 0.12.0 — the engine

The release moves all Lua out of the host process and replaces the 0.11.0
`macht` grammar with an engine: the executable in engine mode, commanded by
the `macht` verb family over a language-neutral wire, under the contract in
[the engine](engine.md). Committed, in build order; each phase ends with every
test lane green and the tree never holds a gap between a removal and its
replacement:

1. **Contract first.** The engine page, and the engine sections of the
   contract, direction, creed, architecture, palette, and parallel guides
   (this phase).
2. **Engine mode in the executable.** A host-only entry that initializes no
   Tcl, runs the frame loop, and hosts the metered-state pool with shard
   threads - the machinery proven in the reken B- and E-spikes, transplanted.
3. **The `macht` family in the host**, built on `child -channels`, `scope`,
   and the job machinery: lifecycle, load/def/run/free/stats, a lazy default
   engine, `-engine` addressing, `-threads`, kernels cached by source hash.
   The private `LuaCell` leaves the host.
4. **The removal.** Grammar, emitter, Tcl arm, router, and oracle deleted from
   the prelude; the test lane rewritten engine-shaped, including the kill of a
   kernel inside one C call; the `macht` reference page rewritten.
5. **Libraries in the engine.** LPeg and lua-cjson as pinned lock entries, the
   built-in `utf8` opened; kernels parse real data from day one.
6. **The loader.** `macht load -csv|-lines`: a correct single-thread C parser
   into typed pools, hostile-fixture-tested at build time.
7. **Version, gates, ship.** The 0.12.0 sweep, a live demo of residency and
   the kill, and the conformance suite run against the built-in engine.

Deliberately not in 0.12.0: a resident engine daemon shared across runs;
bulk transfer of large Tcl-born data (road 1's ceiling applies; files enter by
path); parallel ingestion (the sharded, schema-specialized loader is its own
measured project); and any network. Each is named in the engine contract's
closing section so that its absence is a promise, not an oversight.

## 0.12.0 — the palette gains xml (decided 2026-08-20)

Solid XML handling, validation included, is committed for 0.12.0 as a
palette organ beside `json` — runtime capability, not an extensions-covenant
errand. The deciding programs are the rail-family operations formats
(railML, NeTEx, TAF/TSI, Darwin push data): schema-described XML is the
data plane of long-lived operations environments, and a runtime that
promises "just works for years" must read it in the box.

Recorded as constraints, not answers — the route is design work:

- The leading vendor candidate is tDOM 0.9.7 (C, Tcl 9-ready, bundles
  expat 2.7.3): DOM, XPath, DTD validation, and its own schema engine,
  statically linkable the way SQLite and Lua entered, pinned through the
  dependency lock with its license notices verified and carried. A narrower
  expat-based organ is the fallback if tDOM's surface proves too wide for a
  palette contract.
- "Validation" is pinned by name during design: well-formedness always;
  DTD and tDOM's schema engine are on the table; full W3C XML Schema is
  deliberately not claimed — that claim costs Xerces-class machinery the
  covenant refuses. Whatever subset ships is stated exactly, and the rest
  is refused by name, never approximated.
- The usual admission bar applies: a narrow Tcl-shaped contract, structured
  `{MACHTELD XML ...}` failures with depth/size guards the way `json` has
  them, external-entity and all network resolution refused by default (the
  classic XML trap), manifest metadata, and tests on real rail-format
  fixtures plus hostile ones (XXE, entity expansion, depth bombs).

## 0.13.0 candidates

- The sharded, schema-specialized loader: byte-range parallel parsing into
  column pools, admitted only by a registered throughput prediction.
- Engine-side vectorized primitives exposed to kernels as Lua functions,
  admitted only after a re-profile shows kernels dominate the pipeline.
- A resident engine daemon over a named pipe, with rendezvous and idle policy.
- A sidecar conformance kit: the `macht conform` fixtures packaged for engine
  authors in other languages.

## Candidate additions

Windows registry, services, event log, network facts, users, host facts, and
selected WMI queries remain candidates. None is promised by 0.11.0. Each needs a
concrete program, a narrow Tcl-shaped contract, structured failures, manifest
metadata, and tests on real Windows behavior before admission.

The extensions covenant (see [External libraries](extensions.md)) names its
own candidate machinery: a wrap-time dependency resolver that classifies a
program's requires as in-box, payload, or sidecar; a hashed manifest beside
the output; and a `--deps` mode that verifies it on the target. The policy
is contracted now; the machinery follows the same admission bar as every
verb.

The route to 1.0 is a smaller surface whose invariants have survived use, not a
longer list of verbs. New policy layers and bundled applications are out of
scope for the runtime itself.
