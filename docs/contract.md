# The contract — everything is a dict

The whole surface obeys one invariant: **data, failure, and self-knowledge are the same shape — a Tcl dict** (JSON-isomorphic). One mental model covers output, errors, and the capability manifest.

- **Return values.** Data verbs return dicts; stateful verbs return an **opaque handle token** (see [execution model](execution-model.md)).
- **Errors.** Native Tcl `try` / `throw`; every palette error carries a structured `-errorcode {DOMAIN CODE detail}` plus a machine-readable detail dict. Errors are part of the contract, not prose to string-match.
- **Introspection.** A self-describing **manifest** — `help <verb>` → a dict of signature / options / errors — is the intended end-state ([the creed](creed.md) principle 4); it is *not built yet*. Until then the dict-and-errorcode contract below holds, and Tcl's own `info` / ensembles give runtime introspection.

```tcl
set r [run -timeout 30s -- some.exe]      ;# → {exit 0  status ok  out "…"  err ""  pid 8123  truncated {}}
try { run -- missing.exe } trap {MACHTELD RUN notfound} {m opts} {
    dict get $opts -errorcode             ;# {MACHTELD RUN notfound}
}
```

This invariant is why [the creed](creed.md)'s "palette describes itself" and "errors are the contract" are cheap to honour.
